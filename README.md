# ratatui-table

<!-- cargo-rdme start -->

An experimental evolution of Ratatui's built-in [`Table`] widget.

`ratatui-table` starts with the Table implementation from Ratatui main at
[`3d8639c`]. Version 0.1.0 is intended to render like that built-in Table while giving Table
contributors room to explore borders, virtualization, selection, marking, borrowed data, and
other changes independently.

[`3d8639c`]: https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/commit/3d8639cbb2f910200f30e680a8923ccaf99ba1bf
[`Table`]: https://docs.rs/ratatui-table/latest/ratatui_table/struct.Table.html

This crate is an opt-in development path for the built-in widget, not a competing Table design.
If the experiment succeeds, Ratatui should be able to offer an easy upgrade or re-export path.
No such re-export is implemented or promised yet.

## Stability

Releases before 1.0 may make breaking changes in minor versions. Each breaking release should
document how to migrate. The 0.1.0 baseline deliberately avoids folding the existing Table
proposals into the initial extraction so each proposal remains independently reviewable.

## Installation

```shell
cargo add ratatui-table
```

## Example

```rust
use ratatui::layout::Constraint;
use ratatui_table::{Row, Table};

let rows = [
    Row::new(["Alice", "Engineer"]),
    Row::new(["Bob", "Designer"]),
];
let widths = [Constraint::Length(10), Constraint::Length(12)];
let table = Table::new(rows, widths);
```

## Ratatui compatibility

[`Table::block`][block] accepts a ratatui-widgets [`Block`][block-widget] to preserve the
built-in API. This means the initial crate depends on `ratatui-widgets` with default features
disabled. A future Ratatui facade can re-export this crate without requiring this crate to
become part of `ratatui-widgets` itself.

## Feature flags

- `std` enables the standard-library features of the Ratatui dependencies. The Table itself
  remains usable with `no_std` plus `alloc` by default.
- `serde` adds serialization and deserialization for [`TableState`],
  [`HighlightSpacing`][hs], and [`HighlightPlacement`][hp].

[hp]: https://docs.rs/ratatui-table/latest/ratatui_table/enum.HighlightPlacement.html
